Introduction
------------
I love using vim for all my development, I have included my setup in case anyone wants to play with it. It's predominantly setup for writing prose as well as development in Python. 

## Quickstart 

* Clone the repo and link it to your .vim folder in your homedrive. I use ~/.local/src/vim for all my projects, so once it's cloned, I link it like this
* ln -s /home/username/.local/src/vim /home/username/.vim
* or if you want to clone it directly to your .vim folder, use "git clone git@github.com:CodePoetSarah/vim.git .vim"
* Lastly, symlink the VIMRC and GVIMRC files to your home directory as .vimrc and gvirmrc
* To install the plugins, use ":PlugInstall" and it will install them.
  
If you have a problem or a question, raise a ticket in the issue que and I will look at it when I can.
